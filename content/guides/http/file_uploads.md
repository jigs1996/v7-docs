- Set up FlyDrive for permanent file storage
- Move files from temporary to permanent storage locations
- Handle multiple file uploads in a single request
- Implement direct uploads to cloud storage providers
- Secure your file upload endpoints against abuse

## Overview

File uploads allow users to send files from their browsers to your AdonisJS application. Unlike many Node.js frameworks that require additional packages for this functionality, AdonisJS has built-in support for parsing multipart requests and processing file uploads through its bodyparser.

When a file is uploaded, AdonisJS automatically saves it to the server's `tmp` directory. From there, you can validate the file in your controllers and then move it to permanent storage. 

For permanent storage, AdonisJS integrates with FlyDrive, which provides a unified API for working with local file systems as well as cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3, Cloudflare R2, and Google Cloud Storage.

## Creating your first file upload

We'll build a feature that allows users to update their profile avatar. This is a common requirement and demonstrates all the essential concepts.

::::steps

:::step{title="Create the upload form"}

First, create a form that accepts file uploads. The critical part is setting `enctype="multipart/form-data"` on the form element. Without this attribute, the browser won't send files correctly.

```edge title="resources/views/pages/profile.edge"
@form({ route: 'profile_avatar.update', enctype: 'multipart/form-data' })
  @field.root({ name: 'avatar' })
    @!input.control({ type: 'file' })
    @!field.label({ text: 'Upload new avatar' })
    @!field.error()
  @end
  
  @!button({ type: 'Submit', text: 'Update Avatar' })
@end
```

:::

:::step{title="Register the route"}

Next, register a route to handle the file upload.

```ts title="start/routes.ts"
import router from '@adonisjs/core/services/router'
import { controllers } from '#generated/controllers'

router.put('/profile/avatar', [controllers.profileAvatar, 'update'])
```

:::

:::step{title="Create the controller"}

Now create a controller that accepts the uploaded file. The `request.file()` method gives you access to the uploaded file by its field name.

```ts title="app/controllers/profile_avatar_controller.ts"
import { HttpContext } from '@adonisjs/core/http'

export default class ProfileAvatarController {
  async update({ request, response }: HttpContext) {
    const avatar = request.file('avatar')
    
    if (!avatar) {
      return response.badRequest('Please upload an avatar image')
    }
    
    console.log(avatar)
    
    return 'Avatar uploaded successfully'
  }
}
```

At this point, your application can receive file uploads. The file is already saved in the tmp directory when you access it. The file object contains useful properties:

- `tmpPath` - Where the file is currently stored on your server
- `clientName` - The original filename from the user's computer
- `size` - File size in bytes
- `extname` - File extension (e.g., 'jpg', 'png')
- `type` - MIME type (e.g., 'image/jpeg')

:::

## Validating uploaded files

Accepting any file without validation is dangerous. Users might upload files that are too large, have incorrect formats, or could even be malicious. AdonisJS provides two approaches for validation.

### Inline validation

You can validate files directly in the `request.file()` call by passing validation options as the second argument.

```ts title="app/controllers/profile_avatar_controller.ts"
import { HttpContext } from '@adonisjs/core/http'

export default class ProfileAvatarController {
  async update({ request, response }: HttpContext) {
    const avatar = request.file('avatar', {
      size: '2mb',
      extnames: ['jpg', 'png', 'jpeg']
    })
    
    if (!avatar) {
      return response.badRequest('Please upload an avatar image')
    }
    
    if (avatar.hasErrors) {
      return response.badRequest(avatar.errors)
    }
    
    return 'Avatar uploaded and validated successfully'
  }
}
```

The validation happens as soon as you call `request.file()`. If the file is too large or has an invalid extension, the `avatar.hasErrors` property will be `true` and the `avatar.errors` array will contain error messages.

### VineJS validation (recommended)

While inline validation works, using VineJS validators is the recommended approach because it provides better error messages, consistent validation patterns, and easier testing.

First, create a validator file.

```ts title="app/validators/user.ts"
import vine from '@vinejs/vine'

export const updateAvatarValidator = vine.create({
  avatar: vine.file({
    size: '2mb',
    extnames: ['jpg', 'png', 'jpeg']
  })
})
```

Then use the validator in your controller.

```ts title="app/controllers/profile_avatar_controller.ts"
import { HttpContext } from '@adonisjs/core/http'
import { updateAvatarValidator } from '#validators/user'

export default class ProfileAvatarController {
  async update({ request }: HttpContext) {
    const payload = await request.validateUsing(updateAvatarValidator)
    
    console.log(payload.avatar)
    
    return 'Avatar validated successfully'
  }
}
```

If validation fails, AdonisJS automatically returns a 422 response with detailed error messages. If validation succeeds, you get the validated data in the payload object. The avatar has passed size and extension checks at this point.

:::tip{title="Security feature"}
A key security feature of AdonisJS is that it uses [magic number detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)) to validate file types. This means even if someone renames a `.exe` file to `.jpg`, AdonisJS will detect the actual file type and reject it. This protects your application from users trying to bypass validation by simply changing file extensions.

## Setting up FlyDrive for permanent storage

Files uploaded through forms are temporarily stored in the `tmp` directory. Most operating systems automatically clean up temporary files, so you cannot rely on them persisting. For permanent storage, you need to move files to a location where they will be preserved.

AdonisJS uses FlyDrive for permanent file storage. FlyDrive provides a unified API that works with local file systems during development and cloud storage providers like S3 or R2 in production.

### Installing FlyDrive

Run the following command to install and configure FlyDrive.

```bash
node ace add @adonisjs/drive
```

This command installs the `@adonisjs/drive` package and creates a `config/drive.ts` configuration file. The `@adonisjs/drive` package is a thin wrapper over FlyDrive that integrates seamlessly with AdonisJS. For detailed configuration options, refer to the [FlyDrive documentation](https://flydrive.dev) and the Drive reference guide.

After installation, FlyDrive is ready to use with a local disk configuration for development.

### Moving files to permanent storage

Once FlyDrive is installed, you can move validated files from the `tmp` directory to permanent storage. The `@adonisjs/drive` package extends the file object with a `moveToDisk()` method that handles this automatically.

```ts title="app/controllers/profile_avatar_controller.ts"
import { HttpContext } from '@adonisjs/core/http'
import string from '@adonisjs/core/helpers/string'
import { updateAvatarValidator } from '#validators/user'

export default class ProfileAvatarController {
  async update({ request, auth }: HttpContext) {
    const payload = await request.validateUsing(updateAvatarValidator)
    
    const fileName = `${string.uuid()}.${payload.avatar.extname}`
    
    await payload.avatar.moveToDisk(fileName)
    
    const user = auth.getUserOrFail()
    user.avatarFileName = fileName
    await user.save()
    
    return 'Avatar uploaded and saved successfully'
  }
}
```

We generate a unique filename using UUID to prevent collisions. Multiple users might upload files named "avatar.jpg", so we need unique names to prevent overwriting.

The `moveToDisk()` method moves the file from tmp to permanent storage. It uses the configured disk, which is the local filesystem in development or cloud storage in production.

After moving the file, you should store the filename in the database so you can retrieve it later. You'll need this to display the avatar or allow users to download it.

After moving the file, two new properties become available on the file object:

- `fileName` - The name you specified when moving the file
- `filePath` - The full path where the file was stored

By default, FlyDrive stores files in the `storage` directory when using the local disk. The `@adonisjs/drive` package includes a built-in file server that automatically serves uploaded files. The file server registers a route at `/uploads` followed by your directory structure, making files accessible without additional configuration.

For example, if you store a file as `avatars/123e4567.jpg`, it will be accessible at `/uploads/avatars/123e4567.jpg`.

## Intermediate: Uploading multiple files

Many applications need to accept multiple files in a single request. For example, allowing users to upload several documents for a project, or multiple product images at once.

### Accepting multiple files in the form

To accept multiple files, add the `multiple` attribute to your file input and use an array-style field name.

```edge title="resources/views/pages/project.edge"
@form({ route: 'projects.documents.store', enctype: 'multipart/form-data' })
  @field.root({ name: 'documents[]' })
    @!input.control({ type: 'file', multiple: true })
    @!field.label({ text: 'Upload project documents' })
    @!field.error()
  @end
  
  <button type="submit">Upload Documents</button>
@end
```

### Accessing multiple files

Use `request.files()` (plural) instead of `request.file()` to access multiple uploaded files.

```ts title="app/controllers/project_documents_controller.ts"
import { HttpContext } from '@adonisjs/core/http'

export default class ProjectDocumentsController {
  async store({ request, response }: HttpContext) {
    const documents = request.files('documents')
    
    if (documents.length === 0) {
      return response.badRequest('Please upload at least one document')
    }
    
    console.log(`Received ${documents.length} documents`)
    
    return 'Documents uploaded successfully'
  }
}
```

This method returns an array of file objects, even if only one file was uploaded.

### Validating multiple files

With VineJS, use `vine.array()` to validate an array of files.

```ts title="app/validators/project.ts"
import vine from '@vinejs/vine'

export const uploadDocumentsValidator = vine.compile(
  vine.object({
    documents: vine.array(
      vine.file({
        size: '5mb',
        extnames: ['pdf', 'doc', 'docx', 'txt']
      })
    )
  })
)
```

Each file in the array must meet the specified size and extension requirements.

### Processing multiple files

Loop through the validated files and move each one to permanent storage individually.

```ts title="app/controllers/project_documents_controller.ts"
import { HttpContext } from '@adonisjs/core/http'
import string from '@adonisjs/core/helpers/string'
import { uploadDocumentsValidator } from '#validators/project'

export default class ProjectDocumentsController {
  async store({ request, params }: HttpContext) {
    const payload = await request.validateUsing(uploadDocumentsValidator)
    const fileNames: string[] = []
    
    for (const document of payload.documents) {
      const fileName = `${string.uuid()}.${document.extname}`
      await document.moveToDisk(fileName)
      fileNames.push(fileName)
    }
    
    return { message: 'Documents uploaded', count: fileNames.length }
  }
}
```

You'll want to store the array of filenames in your database. You might store this as JSON or create separate records in a documents table.

The process for multiple files is similar to single files, but you work with arrays instead of individual objects. Each file in the array has the same properties and methods as single files, including `moveToDisk()`.

## Advanced: Direct uploads

Direct uploads allow files to be uploaded directly from the browser to cloud storage providers like S3, R2, or Google Cloud Storage, completely bypassing your AdonisJS server. 

Instead of the standard flow where files travel from `browser → your server → cloud storage`, direct uploads go straight from `browser → cloud storage`. Your server only generates a short-lived signed URL that grants temporary permission to upload to a specific location.

This pattern is recommended when handling large file uploads, typically above 100MB. Building a fault-tolerant and resumable upload server for large files is complex work. By using direct uploads, you offload that responsibility to specialized services designed for this purpose. 

Additional benefits include reduced server bandwidth usage, better upload performance for users, and built-in resumable uploads from cloud providers.

### Implementing direct uploads

You'll need an account with a cloud storage provider like Amazon S3, Cloudflare R2, or Google Cloud Storage. Make sure FlyDrive is configured with your cloud provider credentials (refer to the Drive reference guide for configuration details).

Create an endpoint that generates signed upload URLs.

```ts title="start/routes.ts"
import router from '@adonisjs/core/services/router'
import drive from '@adonisjs/drive/services/main'

router.post('/signed-upload-url', async ({ request }) => {
  const fileName = request.input('file_name')
  
  const url = await drive.use('r2').getSignedUploadUrl(fileName, {
    expiresIn: '30 mins',
  })
  
  return { signedUrl: url }
})
```

The client provides the filename they want to upload. You should consider validating this and generating unique filenames to prevent collisions.

The signed URL expires after 30 minutes to prevent long-term unauthorized access. Replace 'r2' with your configured disk name (could be 's3', 'gcs', etc.).

### Client-side implementation

The client-side code is more complex than standard form uploads. You'll need a JavaScript library that handles the upload process, progress tracking, and error handling. Popular libraries include [Uppy.io](https://uppy.io/), [Filepond](https://pqina.nl/filepond/), or you can use native JavaScript with the Fetch API for custom implementations.

Here's a high-level example using the Fetch API.

```javascript
// Client-side JavaScript example
async function uploadFile(file) {
  // Step 1: Request a signed URL from your server
  const response = await fetch('/signed-upload-url', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ file_name: file.name })
  })
  
  const { signedUrl } = await response.json()
  
  // Step 2: Upload directly to cloud storage using the signed URL
  await fetch(signedUrl, {
    method: 'PUT',
    body: file,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': file.type
    }
  })
  
  console.log('File uploaded successfully!')
}
```

The first step requests a signed URL from your AdonisJS application. The second step uses that URL to upload the file directly to cloud storage.

For production applications, consider using a library like Uppy.io that provides additional features like upload progress tracking, automatic retries, resumable uploads, and user-friendly interfaces.

## Security: Restricting file upload routes

Now that you understand how to implement file uploads, it's important to secure your application against potential abuse.

By default, AdonisJS processes multipart requests (file uploads) on all routes that use `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` methods. This means any endpoint in your application can potentially receive and process file uploads, even if you didn't intend for it to handle files. This unrestricted access allows attackers to target any endpoint in your application to upload files, potentially straining your server's resources, filling up disk space, or using your application to distribute malicious content.

As a first security measure, you must enable file uploads only on specific routes that actually need to handle files. Configure this in your bodyparser settings.

```ts title="config/bodyparser.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@adonisjs/core/bodyparser'

export default defineConfig({
  allowedMethods: ['POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE'],
  
  multipart: {
    enabled: ['/profile/avatar', '/users/:id', '/projects/:id/files']
  },
})
```

This configuration ensures that only the specified routes will process multipart requests. All other routes will reject file uploads, preventing attackers from uploading files to random endpoints.

If you have public endpoints that accept file uploads (endpoints that don't require authentication), apply strict rate limiting to prevent abuse. See the rate limiting guide for implementation details.

For comprehensive bodyparser configuration options, refer to the BodyParser reference guide.
